                          New York is taking steps to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

                          To protect your health and others', everyone must complete an online passenger locator form before arrival in NYC.
                          You may be required to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. Check the exempt countries list immediately before you travel as this list can change at short notice.
                          It is a legal requirement that you wear a face covering on public transport in NYC.
                          Failure to comply with the above measures is a criminal offence and you could be fined. Please visit www.cbp.gov for detailed public health advice and requirements for entering New York.
